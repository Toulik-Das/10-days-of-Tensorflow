# Day 1 :
   ### Tensorflow Object Detection API :
Creating accurate machine learning models capable of localizing and identifying multiple objects in a single image remains a core challenge in computer vision. The TensorFlow Object Detection API is an open source framework built on top of TensorFlow that makes it easy to construct, train and deploy object detection models. At Google weâ€™ve certainly found this codebase to be useful for our computer vision needs, and we hope that you will as well.
